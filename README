This is an archive of dist-sam.zip from https://bitbucket.org/mtrS/pf9.
I had to grab it from the Internet Archive at the following URL:
https://web.archive.org/web/20170809045738/https://bitbucket.org/mtrS/pf9

It also contains the (probably useless) "repository" and "repository metadata"
from https://bitbucket-archive.softwareheritage.org/projects/mt/mtrS/pf9.html
I wasn't able to reconstruct a commit history from this, but maybe somebody else
can.

I'm unlikely to work on this, so it is provided for historical interest (it was
linked from Uriel's sam page).

The original README follows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Pf9' is a port of some libraries and programs from `Plan9 from
User Space' (http://www.swtch.com/plan9port/) to Windows
using the MinGW compiler. A lot of files are used without
modification, some need only slight adaptions. The actual porting
has been done in lib9/mingw and libthread/mingw.c, with
help of ideas from inferno and 9pm.

See LICENSE file for which licenses apply to the source files.

For a list of ported programs see DIRS and TARG definitions
in src/cmd/mkfile.

For a list of ported libraries see src/lib*. Status of some
libraries:

	libthread: works mostly, daemonizing works not

	libdraw:	works basically, tested with tcolors, acme
		and sam. Events have not been ported, so only
		programs using the thread-based mouse
		interface will run.


Status of the support of various concepts:

Pipes
	Implemented using Named Pipes.

Unix Sockets
	Implemented using Named Pipes. You can use the same
	addresses as in plan9port, e.g. unix!/tmp/acme.

Internet Sockets
	Implemented using Winsock.

Unicode
	All programs get UTF-8 encoded streams on stdin, UTF-8
	encoded environment and command line arguments.

Console support
	Reading from the console input and writing to the console
	screen buffer is supported transparently. A "cat > file" from
	the Windows console will produce UTF-8 characters, regardless
	of which codepage is installed.

	You can also use the history feature of the console window without
	extra support in programs.

Because the mkfile system's structure has been derived from Plan9, you
can compile the libs and sources for Linux and MinGW in a similar way:
On Linux, to compile for the MinGW, run

	cd src
	objtype=mingw
	mk


Copy identical files from Plan9port
---------------------------

A lot of files are used from plan9port without change. They are not distributed
along with pf9. You should have a plan9port distribution installed, and the
PLAN9 variable set.

You can run

	mk pop		- to populate the source directory with identical
					source files from p9p

	mk rm		... remove identical source files; this undos the
				effect of `mk pop'

	mk tkdiff		... to get a list of tkdiff commands you can click at in rc to
				explore the differences between p9p and pf9

	mk eqdiff		... like `mk tkdiff', but this time a list showing on which
				files an ed script has been run.

Some files will be modified slightly after copying from plan9port. This
is done using one ed script per file.


How to build for mingw
-------------------

1.	Set `PF9' to the main directory of this distribution. Set cputype
	and objtype:
		cputype=lin386
		objtype=mingw

	You might just run `sh misc/enterpf9' alternatively, which should
	start an rc shell with these values already set (it won't affect the
	environment of the calling shell).
	
2.	Set PATH to include the necessary bin directories $cputype/bin and
	$cpusys/bin, i.e. lin386/bin and linux/bin. They should come
	before the PLAN9/bin directory, to avoid conflicts. If you have
	run `misc/enterpf9' in step 1, this has already been done.

3.	You should have run `mk pop' once to copy identical source files from
	your plan9port distribution, and to apply changes, where neccessary.

4.		cd src
		mk
		mk install
	
	This should build all the programs, on success you will
	find them in mingw/bin.

5.	To get a distribution for windows, e.g. the compiled binaries
	and additional files like troff fonts from plan9port, look into
	dist/mingw/mkfile.

	This needs some further explanations ...



Run it
-----

	FIXME
	
	This should be enough to get it work. Now you might generate the
	lookman index from a shell prompt, which is a good test of some
	of the functionality:

		$ rc
		% cd $PF9/sys/man
		% ./mkindex


Debugging
--------

Define FDTDEBUG=2 to get debug output from the file descriptor layer.
