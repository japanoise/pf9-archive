-	As there is no `inode' defined on Windows file systems,
	the qid.path member of a `Dir' struct is always set to
	zero at the moment. This can be a problem if some code
	relies on qid.path being equal for the same but not for
	different files.

	In sam this situation is causing a warning about possibly
	aliased files (io.c:checkqid()), but it seems not to break
	consistency.

-	When the file descriptor of the server side of a named pipe is
	closed, it is disconnected only, but the handle is not closed. This
	causes in an increasing number of used handles for each listen()
	or pipe() call.	-- FIXED.
